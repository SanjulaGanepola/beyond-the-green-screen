🗺️ 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟲) - Breadcrumb Navigation in Code for IBM i

Breadcrumbs are a handy navigation feature in VS Code that show the path to your current file—and they do more than you might expect. Not only can you use them to navigate between folders and files, but also between symbols within your code.

What’s even better is that they work in QSYS and IFS too! One way I often use breadcrumbs is when I am editing a source member within a filter and realize I need to open another member in the same library—but it is not visible under the current filter. Instead of adjusting the filter itself, I use breadcrumbs to browse the library and access what I need.
