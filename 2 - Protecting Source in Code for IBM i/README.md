🔒 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟮) - Protecting Source in Code for IBM i

Whether you are working with *ALLOBJ authority or just want to prevent accidental changes to your source code, Code for IBM i offers several options to help protect your source:
1. Default Open Mode – Sets the default behavior when opening a source member or stream file. This applies globally across all connections.
2. Read-Only Mode – A connection-specific setting that always opens source members and stream files in read-only mode. You can still override this by right-clicking the item and selecting Open → Edit.
3. Protected Paths – Lets you designate specific libraries or IFS directories as protected for a connection. This protection cannot be overridden.
4. Protected Filter – Protects all source members within a given filter. Like protected paths, this cannot be overridden.
