🛢️ 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟯) - SQL Prefixes in Db2 for IBM i

One of my favourite features in the Db2 for IBM i extension is its support for SQL prefixes, which let you view result sets in multiple formats with ease. To try this out, simply open an SQL file and start your statement with one of these prefixes:
  • json - Result set as JSON
  • csv - Result as CSV
  • sql - Result set as SQL insert statement
  • rpg - Result set as an RPG data structure
  • cl - Run CL commands

Shoutout to @LiamAllan and @ScottForstie for this great feature!
