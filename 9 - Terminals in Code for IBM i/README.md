📟 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟵) - Terminals in Code for IBM i

Adopting new tools doesn't mean abandoning the ones you're used to working with. With Code for IBM i, accessing traditional interfaces like the 5250 terminal is easier than ever. Just hover over your connection and select "Terminal" to open a 5250 or PASE terminal (or use the Ctrl + Shift + J shortcut for convenience). What I like to do is to move it into its own dedicated window which allows me to jump back and forth between the terminal and my code without cluttering my workspace.

Bonus tip: You can also open a PASE terminal from the IFS Browser—just right-click any directory and choose "Open Terminal Here".
