🎉 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟯) - RPG Unit Testing in VS Code

Today’s tip is technically more than a tip — it’s an announcement in disguise.

The brand new IBM i Testing extension for VS Code just dropped and it’s a game changer for RPG and COBOL developers on IBM i! The extension leverages RPGUnit, the popular open-source unit testing framework, to bring a modern testing experience to the IBM i world. If you have written tests in Java, Python, or JavaScript before, the workflow will feel very familiar. The goal is to make it as intuitive as possible to write, compile, run tests, and generate code coverage — all with a single click inside your editor.

One of the best features is the built-in test stub generation. Whether you are new to unit testing or just tired of repeating boilerplate code when getting started, this feature can scaffold an entire test suite with everything you need: required includes, prototypes, and structured sections for declarations, inputs, actual vs expected results, and assertions. All you need to do as the developer is fill in the inputs and expected results, and you're ready to run your tests.
