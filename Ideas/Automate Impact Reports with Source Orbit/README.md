📋 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 ?) - Automate Impact Reports with Source Orbit

Continuing from Day ?, where we automated builds using ibmi-ci—let’s take it a step further. What if every pull request not only triggered a build, but also told you exactly what objects were impacted by the changes?

With Source Orbit, you can now automatically generate impact reports as part of your CI pipeline. These reports give you visibility into:
  • Direct objects that were touched
  • Dependent objects that are impacted
  • Project-wide dependency relationships
