👨‍💻 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 ?) - CL Content Assist

One of the most common questions we get is "How do I prompt for CL commands in VS Code?". Unlike RDi or the traditional green screen, VS Code does not bring up a dedicated UI for command prompting. Instead, it uses Content Assist to guide you through parameters seamlessly.

Here is an example of how it works:
1. Type your CL command (e.g. CRTDTAARA) followed by a space.
2. Press Ctrl + Space to trigger Content Assist to see a list of command parameters.
3. Select "All parameters" for a full command skeleton or pick specific ones.
4. You can even use Content Assist within the parameters themselves to get context-aware suggestions for special values or available variable.
