Adopting new tools does not mean abandoning the old ones. With Code for IBM i, accessing traditional interfaces like the 5250 terminal is easier than ever. Just hover over your connection and select "Terminal" to open a 5250 or PASE terminal (or use the Ctrl + Shift + J shortcut).

Bonus tip: You can also open a PASE terminal from the IFS Browser—just right-click any directory and choose "Open Terminal Here".
