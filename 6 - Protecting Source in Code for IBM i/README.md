🔒 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟲) - Protecting Source in Code for IBM i

Whether you are working with *ALLOBJ authority or just want to prevent accidental changes to your source code, Code for IBM i offers several options to help protect your source:

𝟭. 𝗗𝗲𝗳𝗮𝘂𝗹𝘁 𝗢𝗽𝗲𝗻 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲 – Sets the default behavior when opening a source member or stream file. This applies globally across all connections.
𝟮. 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱-𝗢𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲 – A connection-specific setting that always opens source members and stream files in read-only mode. You can still override this by right-clicking the item and selecting Open → Edit.
𝟯. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝗵𝘀 – Lets you designate specific libraries or IFS directories as protected for a connection. This protection cannot be overridden.
𝟰. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 – Protects all source members within a given filter. Like protected paths, this cannot be overridden.
