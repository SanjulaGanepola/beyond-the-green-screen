📜 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗚𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗦𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗲𝗻 (𝗗𝗮𝘆 𝟭𝟱) - CL Command Docs in VS Code

Writing CL just got easier with the latest enhancements in the CL extension (v1.2.0). Command documentation is now available right in the editor, so you no longer need to leave VS Code to look it up.

• 𝗛𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝘂𝗽𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁: Hover over any command or parameter to see a subsections of relevant documentation
• 𝗪𝗲𝗯𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝘀: View the full command documentation in a webview directly in VS Code
• 𝗘𝗻𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁: Parameter suggestions now include documentation as well (not just parameter names, special values, etc.)

These features pair perfectly with the CL Syntax Checker which helps catch errors as you edit your code.
